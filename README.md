## üìå Introduction
This project explores a dataset sourced from Kaggle containing product listings for Adidas USA. The dataset, originally in CSV format, was converted to Excel for analysis.

Our objective is to clean, analyze, and visualize the data to uncover insights about product distribution, pricing, customer preferences, and more. This analysis serves as a foundational step toward building a dashboard for business insights.

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preparation
### 1. Column Review & Removal
Inspected all columns for relevance.

Removed: Currency: All values are in USD, URL: Not needed for our analysis, Crawled_at: Timestamp irrelevant to business context.

### 2. Data Type Conversion
Converted selling_price from text to numeric format to enable accurate calculations.

### 3. Discount Calculation
In the absence of an explicit discount column, we used: 
=IF(OR(ISBLANK(F3), F3=0), 0, (F3-D3)/F3) assuming F3 as original_price and D3 as selling_price

### 4. Standardizing Color Values
Identified duplicate entries due to inconsistent naming (e.g., Multi color, MultiColor, and Multi).

Used Advanced Find & Replace to standardize all values to Multi.

### 5. Category Subdivision
The breadcrumbs column contained category hierarchies (e.g., Men/Clothing).
Used Excel's TEXTSPLIT function to extract the top-level category:
=INDEX(TEXTSPLIT(J2, "/"), 1) assuming J2 as the category_column

### 6. Image Count Extraction
Product images were concatenated using ~ as a separator.
Counted the number of images using:
=LEN(M2)-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(M2,"~",""))+1  assuming M2 as the column with images
This formula calculates how many image URLs are associated with each product.

Data is now clean and ready for exploratory analysis. 

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### 1. Category-Wise Product Count
Created a Pivot Table:
